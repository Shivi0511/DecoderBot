This project aims to analyze and visualize various aspects of Netflix content using Power BI. The dataset sourced from #DecoderBot includes information about Netflix shows, their ratings, availability in different regions, and classification into movies versus TV Show. Prior to visualization, the dataset undergoes cleaning and preprocessing using Excel and Power Query. By leveraging Power BI's capabilities, the project aims to provide insights into the distribution of Netflix content across regions, compare the popularity and ratings of movies versus TV Show, and explore trends in viewer preferences. Through interactive visualizations, this project seeks to offer a comprehensive understanding of Netflix's content landscape.
